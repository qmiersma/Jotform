Ideally I want widget.js to perform logic for all widgets, not sure if this is possible without the script becoming huge, tho

TODO: 
- Remove all these global variables because it's difficult to keep track of where they are and what's referencing them
- Abstract 

QUESTIONS: 
- Will there possibly be multiple input fields in one widget? Because then we need to add event listeners by class using loop
- Can I have multiple widgets in one HTML file? Or is it taking the entire file for one widget? NO and YES
- Would you want liveSearch to be used for anything else? 
- Where is resultsContainer being defined?? Who knows
